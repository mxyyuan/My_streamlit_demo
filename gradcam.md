### GradCAM
> GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) is a visualization technique that highlights important regions in an input image by examining the gradients flowing into the final convolutional layer of a neural network. It helps understand where a deep learning model focuses when making predictions, aiding in interpretability and model debugging.
